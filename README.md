# AgileGardening.Android
This is the client Android application for a gardening application prototype that lets users find flowers' gardening information with their image as input

A user will take a picture with his/her camera, and then using [Clarifai](https://www.clarifai.com/) apis, the server will get the classification information and matches it to the flower record in the databse. The gardening information will then be shown to the user.
